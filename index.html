            St Xavier’s College canteen holds a special place for every Xavierite. Students, as well as alumni, spend hours chilling at the canteen, during and even after their break. The graffiti at the canteen offers a colourful backdrop that adds to the vibe of the place. “There is so much to choose from here, both in vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. There is usually a special menu on Saturdays, and students really look forward to it. I have heard vada pav is the biggest attraction here. My friends and I can’t wait to explore all the options here,” says Valencia Dias, a first year student.
